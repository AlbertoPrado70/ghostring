&LTa href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/<b><i>YOUR_SLUG</i></b>/previous">&LT-&LT/a>
<br>
&LTa href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/">Ghostring&LT/a>
<br>
&LTa href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/<b><i>YOUR_SLUG</i></b>/next">->&LT/a>
</code><br><br> (Replace "YOUR_SLUG" with a keyword representing your site - for example, "kersed" for "kersed.net") <br><br> This HTML makes the webring work, allowing new visitors to stumble onto your site! <br> My webring software (<a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ringfairy>ringfairy</a>) generates web pages for each slug, which automatically redirect visitors to the sites adjacent to each other in the webring. This way, the links connect us all together in a looping structure. <br><br> It's okay if you want to tinker or customize the links, like by changing the arrow characters, or using images/buttons instead of pure text, etc. <br> The important thing is to allow visitors to easily traverse the webring! <br><h3>Information</h3> Once you have the links on your page, there are several ways to get yourself on the list: <ul><li><a href=https://neocities.org/site/ghostring>leave a comment on neocities</a>!<li><a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ghostring>submit a pull request</a>!<li><a href=https://hol.ogra.ph/@kern>message me on fedi</a>!</ul><h3>Required Information</h3> When sending your request, the only required details are your site's <b>URL</b>, and the <b>slug</b> (site keyword) that you picked. I need the slug in order to activate your links. <br><br> Please specify the URL where you put the links, so that visitors can find them. If your links are on your front page, then your normal URL will do. If your links are elsewhere on your site, like on a special "links" page, then please use that page as your URL. <br><br> That's it! If you've added the links & let me know, then you're all set! <br><h3>Optional Information</h3> Optionally, you can also include additional information for your site listing: <ul><li>Full <b>title</b> of your site<li>A brief <b>description</b> of your site<li>Some form of <b>contact info</b> (email, fedi, neocities, etc)<li>If you have one, your <b>RSS</b> link</ul><br> None of the above is required; it only helps flesh out (so to speak) your entry in the directory. <br><h2>Updates</h2> Please understand it may take a few days (or more) to process any requests and update the webring! <br><br> Also, <b>Ghostring now uses a shuffle mode</b>. Every time the webring is regenerated, the sequence is randomized. In other words, each update will scramble everyone's ring neighbors. <br> Some sites get more traffic than others; shuffling the webring helps balance out the traffic. <br><h2>Leaving</h2> Non-compliant websites will occasionally have to be removed. In other words, if Ghostring links can't be found on your site, I'll drop your site from the list. This keeps the webring functional. <br><br> If you purposely want to remove yourself from the Ghostring, it would be very appreciated if you gave me a heads up so I can update the list! Otherwise, it's okay to simply remove the links from your site. Eventually it will get removed. <br><br><br><center> <img src=https://notmerlin.com/other/horrorgifs/lines/line%20(32).gif> </center><footer><small> <p>Updated: 2024-02-15 20:01:08</p> <p>Launched: 2024-02-04</p> <p>Powered by <a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ringfairy>ringfairy</a>!</p> </small></footer>
