I simply put my links in the footer. <br> Don't wait for the webring to be updated; go ahead and add these links right after you apply. Otherwise, the webring will be broken until you update your site. <br> (Remember to replace "YOUR_SLUG" with your actual slug) <br><br><code>
&LTa href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/YOUR_SLUG/previous">&LT-&LT/a>
<br>
&LTa href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/">Ghostring&LT/a>
<br>
&LTa href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/YOUR_SLUG/next">->&LT/a>
</code><br><br> This HTML makes the webring work, allowing new visitors to stumble onto your site. <br> My bespoke webring software (<a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ringfairy>ringfairy</a>) generates web pages for each slug, which automatically redirect visitors to the sites adjacent to each other in the webring. <br> It's crucial that every site in the webring has these links (with their slug) accessible on the front page. Otherwise, the ring would be broken, and the site would need to be removed from the list. <br><br><center> <img src=https://notmerlin.com/other/horrorgifs/lines/line%20(32).gif> </center><footer><small> <p>Updated: 2024-02-13 14:41:29</p> <p>Launched: 2024-02-04</p> <p>Powered by <a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ringfairy>ringfairy</a>!</p> </small></footer>
