A webring for ghosts...

Webrings may seem as ancient as a ghost story whispered through the ages, but the concept is timeless! 
<br><br>
Each site is a doorway to the next, allowing visitors to drift through cryptic corridors of cyberspace... 
<br><br>

Ghostring's <a href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/list.html">membership</a> is <b>open</b> as a vampire's coffin at midnight! 
<br>
If you run a handmade personal website or blog you are welcome. 
<br><br>
I invite any interested readers, writers, artists, skeptics, dreamers, ghouls, ghosts, and other creatures... 
<br>
Here, the moonlight is always right for sharing stories... 
<br><br>

<h2>Joining</h2>

Your site need only be devoid of bigotry & ads, and you should be willing to add the webring links. 
<br>
Add the following webring HTML somewhere on your site (I simply put my links in the footer). 
<br>
(Replace "YOUR_SLUG" with a keyword representing your site - for example, "kersed" for "kersed.net")
<br><br>
<code>
&lt;a href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/YOUR_SLUG/previous"&gt;&lt;-&lt;/a&gt;
<br>
&lt;a href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/">Ghostring&lt;/a&gt;
<br>
&lt;a href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/YOUR_SLUG/next"&gt;-&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code>
<br><br>
This HTML makes the webring work, allowing new visitors to stumble onto your site! 
<br>
My webring software (<a href="https://github.com/k3rs3d/ringfairy">ringfairy</a>) generates web pages for each slug, which automatically redirect visitors to the sites adjacent to each other in the webring. This way, the links connect us all together in a looping structure. 
<br>
It's crucial that every site in the webring has these links (with their slug) accessible on the front page. Otherwise, the ring would be broken.

<h3>Information</h3>
Once you have the links added, there are several ways to get yourself on the list: 
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://neocities.org/site/ghostring">leave a comment on neocities</a>! </li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/k3rs3d/ghostring">submit a pull request</a>! </li>
<li> <a href="https://hol.ogra.ph/@kern">message me on fedi</a>! </li>
</ul>

<h3>Required Information</h3>
When sending your request, the only required details are your site's <b>URL</b>, and the <b>slug</b> (site keyword) that you picked. I need the slug in order to activate your links. 
<br><br>
Please specify the URL where you put the links, so that visitors can find them. If your links are on your front page, then your normal URL will do. If your links are elsewhere on your site, like on a special "links" page, then please use that page as your URL. 
<br><br>
That's it! If you've added the links & let me know, then you're all set! 
<br>
<h3>Optional Information</h3>
Optionally, you can also include additional information for your site listing: 
<ul>
<li>Full <b>title</b> of your site </li>
<li>A brief <b>description</b> of your site </li>
<li>Some form of <b>contact info</b> (email, fedi, neocities, etc) </li>
<li>If you have one, your <b>RSS</b> link </li>
</ul>
<br>
None of the above is required; it only helps flesh out (so to speak) your entry in the directory. 
<br>
Please understand it may take a few days or more to process your request and update the webring! 

<br><br>

<h2>Maintenance</h2>
The webring will be updated periodically. 
<br>
Non-compliant websites will occasionally have to be removed. In other words, if Ghostring links can't be found on your site, I'll drop your site from the list. This keeps the webring functional. 
<br>
If you purposely want to remove yourself from the Ghostring, it would be very appreciated if you gave me a heads up so I can update the list! Otherwise, it's okay to simply remove the links from your site. Eventually it will get removed.
